# DescountCalculator
Hello in Discount Calculator!

Below there are some tips how to use application:

Below there are some tips how to use tests for the application:

2. Enjoy the results of the tests.
Good luck!

Reasons of some decisions:
1. In displaying method I could use my own method to transform String to Currency Format,
    but I found special MethodFormat from text package for it.
2. I could use strategy pattern for example to create the list with given size.
    I didn't do it because creating extra classes wasn't efficient in this case.
3. If you have any doubts about functionality please read the documentation.
